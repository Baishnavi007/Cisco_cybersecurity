## ðŸ“– Project Overview

The **Campus Traffic Analysis** project analyzes network traffic across different branches of a campus.  
Using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, we simulated and monitored traffic flow, topologies, and performance metrics to understand network efficiency and bottlenecks.  

The repository contains:
- **Report (PDF):** Full documentation of methodology, analysis, and conclusions.  
- **Presentation (PPT):** Summary slides for academic/project presentation.  
- **Packet Tracer File (.pkt):** The simulation model of the campus network.  
- **Images (PNG):** Screenshots of network topologies, simulation results, and command outputs.

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Open `projectFile.pkt` using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
2. Load the network topology and run simulations.  
3. Refer to `Images_Output/` for captured results.  
4. Read the **PDF report** or **PPT slides** for detailed explanations.
